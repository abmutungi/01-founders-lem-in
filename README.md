### Lem-In Project

This repository contains files from a project completed at 01 Founders Coding School.

The objective is to code a digital version of an ant farm and the quickest way to get n ants across a colony (composed of rooms and tunnels).

* At the beginning of the game, all the ants are in the room ##start. The goal is to bring them to the room ##end with as few moves as possible although it's important to note that he shortest path is not necessarily the simplest.

A few rules that we had to abide by include:
- Each room can only contain one ant at a time (except at ##start and ##end which can contain as many ants as necessary).
- It will only display the ants that moved at each turn, and can move each ant only once and through a tunnel (the room at the receiving end must be empty).


- Our project uses both depth first search and breadth first search algorithms to find most optimal route for ant(s) to traverse through graph data structure where we've stored the rooms.

This project introduced me to :

- Algorithmic
- Ways to receive data
- Ways to output data
- Manipulation of strings
- Manipulation of graph structure
